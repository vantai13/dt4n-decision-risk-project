"""Topology v7: 2x2 butterfly, K=4, with proper-subset shared links.

This replaces the old symmetric three-path stage for Phase 20. The topology is
a small leaf-spine/Clos fragment: every shared link is used by a proper subset
of paths, so link errors can affect rankings instead of adding a common
constant to every action.

Calibration constraint: link bandwidths stay in {4, 6, 8} Mbps, the measured
bandwidths used by ``results/SUPERSEDED/calib/density_bw{4,6,8}_*.csv``.
